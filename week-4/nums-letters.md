1.What does “puts” do? 
		Puts is short for “put string”. Puts is used to  display the results of evaluating Ruby code and add a new line after it.

2.What is an integer? What is a float?
		An integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal.

3.What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn’t know anything about programming? 
		The difference between float and integer division is that with integer division if the result of the equation is a decimal, it will round down to the nearest whole number. The best way to understand this is in an example. If a slice of pizza is $3 and you have $8, you could only buy 2 slices of pizza because they won’t sell you a fraction of the 3rd slice.

```ruby
puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10
```

1.How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?
		Ruby handles arithmetic the same way a calculator does. It will complete the equation with the operation that is given.
2.What is the difference between integers and floats?
		An integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal.
3.What is the difference between integer and float division?
		Float division will return the answer with a decimal point if the numbers don’t evenly divide. An integer division problem will return the answer rounded down to the nearest whole number.
4.What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
		Strings are groups of letters, punctuation, digits, symbols, and/or spaces. Strings can be used to have words and phrase print. String arithmetic can also be used to have the multiple strings combined into a single phrase.
5.What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?
		Local variables are nested inside of methods and can only be used in that method. They are used to create variables within the method and will not communicate to any code outside of that method.	
6.How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?
		I found this challenge to be straight forward. I was a review from preparing for the interview.
