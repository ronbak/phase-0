1.What does “puts” do? 
	Puts is short for “put string”. Puts is used to  display the results of evaluating Ruby code and add a new line after it.

2.What is an integer? What is a float?
	An integer is a whole number. A float is a number with a decimal.

3.What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn’t know anything about programming? 
	The difference between float and integer division is that with integer division if the result of the equation is a decimal, it will round down to the nearest whole number. The best way to understand this is in an example. If a slice of pizza is $3 and you have $8, you could only buy 2 slices of pizza because they won’t sell you a fraction of the 3rd slice.

```ruby
puts 24*365
puts 60*24*365*10
```
