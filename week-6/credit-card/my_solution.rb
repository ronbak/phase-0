# Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge with: Patrick Skelley.
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# Pseudocode

# Input: A credit card number
# Output: Deterimation of cedit card is valid by returning true of false
# Steps: Setup constuctor to determine if the information provide has the correct number of digits (16)
#   		IF number does not equal 16 digits return error stating "wrong number of digits"
#        Define the first step to validate the card number
#			double ever other digit starting with the first digit
# 		 Define the second step to validate the card number
# 			 Add up all the digits
# 			 	If digit is higher than 9, split number into two digits (10 = 1 + 0)
# 		 Define the thrid step to validate the card number
#   	 	IF total is a multiple of 10 card number is valid return true
# 			If total is not a multiple of 10 card is invaid return false

# Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on initialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits

# Reflection
# 1. What was the most difficult part of this challenge for you and your pair?
# The most difficult part was getting the first step coded in the initial solution. We were able to explain what we 
# wanted the code to accomplish but it took a lot of research and time to actually have it execute properly.

# 2. What new methods did you find to help you when you refactored?
# We used flatten! to modify  the double digits numbers separated in their sub array back to just one array.

# 3. What concepts or learnings were you able to solidify in this challenge?
# I learned how to have the methods pass to each other so when the final method is called the actions of the methods
# above cascade down.
